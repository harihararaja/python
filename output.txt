Free Consent: Free consent is when two or more parties agree on the same thing in the same way 
without being influenced by coercion, fraud, misrepresentation, or other factors. Void contract: A 
void contract is a contract that isn't legally enforceable, starting from the time it was created. While 
both a void and voidable contract are null, a void contract cannot be ratified. In a legal sense, a void 
contract is treated as if it was never created and becomes unenforceable in court. Nature of Agency: 
Agency is a legal relationship where a principal appoints an agent to act on their behalf and under 
their direction. The agent is legally authorized to act on behalf of the principal in business 
transactions. Requisites for negotiable instruments: To be negotiable, an instrument must meet the 
following requirements: • Writing: The instrument must be in writing on a permanent, transferable

cannot be made conditional on an event. • Payable: The instrument must be payable on demand or 
at a fixed time. • Payee: The instrument must be payable to the order of a payee or bearer. If the
